  <h1>Personas</h1>
  <h2>Jose</h2>
  <p>Jose is a 45 year old man. He is a father and currently works full time about an hour away from home. He gets up
    early to make sure he doesn't get stuck in traffic on his way to work each day. He works about an hour and half away
    from his home and doesn't have the chance to go back until his work day is over. When he comes home he looks for
    activities that he can spend time with his family. He likes being out in town, and always checks the internet to see
    if the local activities are appropriate for his family of 2 younger kids and a teenager.</p>
  <h2>Maria</h2>
  <p>Maria is a 20 year old who lives downtown and works in the same town. She is a college student and works part time
    at a restaurant 30 minutes away from home. She has to take public transport each day and hates being out in the rain
    for too long. She also exercises about three times a week and is always looking for new places she can go for a run.
    When she has free time she like to go activities that allow her to spend time with her friends.</p>

  <h2>Scenarios</h2>
