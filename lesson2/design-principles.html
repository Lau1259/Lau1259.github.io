    <h1>Design Principles</h1>
    <p>Design follows basic rules to ensure quality. Below you can find examples of a good use of whitespace,
      repetition,
      and contrast on mobile versions of websites.
    </p>

    <div class="designs">
      <section id="whitespace" class="designPrinciple">
        <h2 class="designTitle">Whitespace</h2>
        <figure class="screenshot">
          <img src="images/Apple.png" alt="Apple.com" height="550">
          <figcaption>Whitespace and clean design from <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple.com</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="designDescription"> Whitespace allows the user to rest their eyes and helps set the focus on the
          content
          provided. Apple uses this principle plenty on their website. It's main use on mobile is to make their content
          stand out and to emphasize the alignment of their elements. Mobile users benefit from this by only having a
          few
          things to look at in one time.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="repetition" class="designPrinciple">
        <h2 class="designTitle">Repetition</h2>
        <figure class="screenshot">
          <img src="images/w3schools.png" alt="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp" height="550px">
          <figcaption>Repetition in design from <a href="#">w3schools.com</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="designDescription">Repetition is al over this site. Some of the repetitions are the font, the heading
          size, the spacing between paragraphs, and the line after each section. The repetition helps users understand
          how
          to interpret information and how it's related to other objects. W3schools uses this to show each block of
          rules
          using a larger heading size at the top of each new section.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="contrast" class="designPrinciple">
        <h2 class="designTitle">Contrast</h2>
        <figure class="screenshot">
          <img src="images/theFutur.png" alt="https://thefutur.com" height="550px">
          <figcaption>Contrast in the top image from <a href="#">thefutur.com</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="designDescription">Contrast is meant to grab the user's attention and immediately get them to pay
          attention to a specific object. theFutur uses this rule as soon as you land on their site. Their main image
          that
          takes up the entire viewport and uses a monochromatic color palette to make the text stand out above all else.
          The contrast helps drive attention.</p>
